# ðŸ’³ GitHub language card
![](./profile-card.svg)

This is a profile card made in a SVG, to be imported into a GitHub profile readme (or elsewhere). It works by using a ``foreignObject`` in a SVG.

---

## Usage
To use the card, either copy the contents of [``profile-card.svg``](./profile-card.svg) or otherwise download it. Then paste it into your personal git repository, and add an image tag in your readme, displaying the SVG, like this: ``![](path/to/profile-card.svg)``

### How to modify
Simply go into the SVG and add entries accordingly. There are 6 categories, all identified by ids; see the SVG as an example.

Note you may need to modify the CSS to accomodate more languages.

### Quirks
Don't forget to change the SVG height and width!

## Acknowledgements
While making this, I used [this CSS animation](https://codepen.io/alvaromontoro/pen/rNwVpdd) as reference, and [this guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/typewriter-effect/). Otherwise everything else is my own work.
